Introduction to IT Group 7 - TEAM TERABYTE

1.1 Test Results
Since we have each completed 3 personality tests to better understand ourselves,
we are able to analyse the differences and similarities between group members.
The key takeaways from these tests are the type of personalities that we each
have and what we offer to the group.

While Joseph is classified as a 'protagonist' that is quite extroverted,
intuitive and feeling based, Nathan, Joel and Anabel were classified as being
the more introverted personality types. This suggests that Nathan, Joel and
Anabel should be able to quietly achieve things within the group, while Joseph
may be more likely to spark the start of a conversation, bringing new topics to
light so that all aspects of the project will be covered.

Interestingly, Nathan has the quality of being introverted but also providing
leadership towards the group, and this has been evident in our work so far.
Anabel is classified as a 'mediator' which is a very important personality to
have in a group. If conflict ever occurs, we may be able to look towards Anabel
to assess the situation and figure out conflict resolution quickly and easily.

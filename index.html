                            <p>My name is Joel Baden, my student number is <strong>S3855896</strong> and I’m a member of Team Terabyte. I’m from Geelong, however have lived in Melbourne for 7 years and travel there often as my base of operations for work and  athletics training. My interests are varied, as I grew up in a musical family I enjoy playing piano and guitar, creating my own music and producing for others. I’ve previously studied philosophy and enjoy a good argument around topics such as religion, logic, meaning etc. IT has always been present in my life, from my first GameBoy, playing games on Desktops, recording music on specialised software, to completing this course through an online means. It’s an important aspect of daily life as I rely on my computer and mobile phone to complete many essential tasks which would not be possible or at least impractical without. Being able to create and record music via a  virtual workstation is one such example, which would not have been possible up until the late 1900’s. In a professional sense, I’m interested in studying I.T and programming due to the growing demand in that sector.</p>

                            <p>Hello, my name is Joseph Tselios, I'm 24 years old and currently live in Melbourne, Australia. My student number is <strong>s3858508</strong> My parents are from Greece and Italy, however I still consider myself to be Australian. My education has been placed on hold for a few years since I started work full time at a very young age however I'm back at it again with a passion to find a career that I am passionate about. A hobby of mine is music, working out and of course, League of Legends. I'm allergic to cats, but still think they are very cute. I have close to no experience in I.T which I know will hinder me when I’m ready to find a job, but I hope that my professionalism gives a company the belief to give me an opportunity. So far working in a group has been quite slow, I can only really blame myself for not interacting sooner. Covid-19 has flipped life on its head but I am now ready to attack this assignment running with my team called ‘ Team Terabyte’ LETS GO!</p>

                         <p class="text-light">Since we each have completed 3 personality tests to better understand ourselves, it is interesting to analyze the differences and similarities between us. The key takeaways from these tests are the type of personalities that we each have and what we offer to the group. While Joseph is classified as a ‘protagonist’ that is quite extroverted, intuitive and feeling based, others in the group share opposite personalities. Daniel seems to share a similar personality as Joseph, being a ‘natural leader’ however Nathan, Joel, and Anabel were classified as being the more introverted personality types. Similar to Joseph, Anabel’s personality also leans towards being intuitive rather than observant. Interestingly enough, Daniel and Nathan share the same personality quality of being introverted but also providing leadership towards the group. This means in our group, Nathan, Joel and Anabel should be able to quietly achieve many things within our group in an organized fashion, while Daniel and I spark the start of conversation and assist in achieving what needs to get done. Anabel is classified as a mediator which is a very important personality to have in a group. If conflict ever occurs, we may be able to look towards Anabel to assess the situation and figure out conflict resolution quickly and easily. I can already say though, While Nathan is classified as introverted, he can and has still offered a leadership role within our group.</p>

                        <p class="pr-3">Within the group we see quite a bit of variation between each other’s ideal jobs. These job positions range in complexity from IT Help Desk Jobs through to AI software engineering positions and while containing some overlap in required knowledge, are mostly distinct in their end goals. Nathan, Joel and Anabel are all interested in what appears to be frontend developing environments that involve user experience, user interface designs and require an in-depth understanding of programming languages like Javascript and CSS. Both Joel and Anabel’s ideal jobs as a web developer and as an iOS developer further require strong graphic design skills and mobile app experience despite the end products being different in nature - website vs iOS applications. Nathan’s job description whilst requiring many of the same skills does not specify a specific platform to which the software will be implemented, perhaps indicating a more general developer role. Daniel’s ideal job as a Software Engineer working with AI is unique in that it involves more back-end development, requiring experience with java, python and AWS, however still involves the design and development of products which is common to the previously mentioned job positions. Joseph’s ideal job for a Level 1 IT Help Desk position requires a different set of skills unique to the rest of the group, including telephone and remote support for end-users, installation and configuring of clients Desktops and on-site technical support. This position does not involve developing products but more so technical support in the service industry. Although all members of the group are currently not qualified for their ideal jobs, everyone is working towards it either through completion of the RMIT I.T degree or other relevant certificates.</p>

                    <p>The total skill set required for all of our ideal jobs is quite varied as outlined in the prior paragraph. In terms of demand from employers, this would include knowledge in: </p>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>SQL(#1)</li>
                            <li>JavaScript(#2)</li>
                            <li>java(#3)</li>
                            <li>Microsoft Windows(#4)</li>
                            <li>building relationships(#8)</li>

                            <li>technical support(#11)</li>
                            <li>customer service(#14)</li>
                            <li>website production(#17)</li>

                        </ul>
                    <p class="pt-3">Many of the baseline skills in demand overlap with our teams skill-set. These include by rank: communication skills(#1), problem solving(#2), organisational skills(#3), team work(#5), troubleshooting(#6), planning(#7), detail-orientated(#8), creativity(#9), research(#10), time-management(#12),  mentoring(#13), meeting deadlines(#16) and analytical skills(#17). The three highest ranked specific skills not required by our groups skill-set would be project management(#5), SAP (#6) and business Management(#7) - as none of our jobs outline a managerial position or deal directly with retail or supply chains. Additionally, the top three baseline skills not required for our skill-set would include writing (#4), leadership(#11) and quality assurance/control (#14). While these last 3 skills may be required in some loose sense within our ideal jobs, they are not the primary focus for our job descriptions.</p>
